# My-Raspberry-Pi-Journey
Hello, there! Welcome to my repository, MyRaspberryPiRaphaelJourney. This is my personal journey of learning and exploring the Raspberry Pi using the [SunFounder Ultimate Raphael Kit](https://raphael-kit.rtfd.io/).

This kit is an educational treasure trove designed for beginners like me to step into the world of Raspberry Pi, programming, and electronics. It comes with an online tutorial containing 161 exciting projects spanning 5 programming languages and a 30-hour video course.

What's in this Repository
In this repository, I'm documenting my progress with each project, sharing code, lessons learned, and hurdles encountered. I believe in learning by doing, and what better way than to work with this kit and record my progress?

My Goals
Learn Raspberry Pi basics, including setting up the Pi and using the GPIO pins and sensors.
Acquire fundamental knowledge in circuits and programming.
Successfully complete the online tutorial projects and video courses.
Experiment with advanced projects using the components provided in the kit.
Ultimately, to be able to build and create my own Raspberry Pi projects.
Progress
I will be updating this section regularly to track my progress through the tutorial. Stay tuned!
